# Introduction #

This project is really just a collection of sample MultiMarkdown documents
demonstrating various features.


## Beamer ##

by Fletcher T. Penney

This is an example of using MultiMarkdown to create a PDF slideshow via
[beamer](http://latex-beamer.sourceforge.net/).


## Manuscript Example ##

by Fletcher T. Penney

This is an example of a file that was styled using MultiMarkdown, the
`manuscript-novel` XSLT, and the `manuscript` package for LaTeX.

Basically, you write in plain text in your favorite word processor or text
editor, export as MultiMarkdown, and convert to a PDF that is "properly"
styled for a manuscript submission. Of course, with a couple of changes to the
metadata, you could format it yourself for printing as well.... Worth looking
at just to see what MultiMarkdown can do! Includes source MMD text file and
the final pdf.

**PS**: The TeX file produced by this process is better typeset using XeLaTeX,
rather than LaTeX.


## OmniOutliner ##

by Fletcher T. Penney

This contains a sample OmniOutliner document, as well as the exported
MultiMarkdown text file and HTML version, including the embedded image.

## Sample Document ##

by Fletcher T. Penney

This is the original MultiMarkdown Sample Document. The source file,
`sample.txt`, demonstrates the original MultiMarkdown markup. The other files
show the output when converted to HTML/XHTML, TeX (using `mmd2LaTeX.pl`) PDF
(using `mmd2pdf.pl`), RTF (using the `multimarkdown2RTF.pl` script), and RTFD
(using TextEdit to convert the XHTML document to RTF with images).


## Sample Letter ##

by Fletcher T. Penney

This is an example of what can be done with the new letterhead feature of MMD
version 2.0.b4. The base version can be used with LaTeX, but if you want to
add custom font features using my customized version, you need to use XeLaTeX
(Mac OS X only, for the most part). LaTeX gurus can get font changes on
regular LaTeX installs, but this was easier for me.


## What Is MultiMarkdown? ##

by Fletcher T. Penney

Another slideshow created via beamer, but this one is also a beginner's intro
to what MultiMarkdown is.
