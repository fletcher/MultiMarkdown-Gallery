<outline text="Introduction" _note="As I  add increasing numbers  of features to  MultiMarkdown, I decided  it was&#10;time to create  a sample document to  show them off. Many of  the features are&#10;demonstrated in the [MultiMarkdown User's Guide][], but some are not.&#10;&#10;Additionally,  it's easy  for those  features to  get lost  within all  of the&#10;technical  documentation.  This document  is  designed  to *demonstrate*,  not&#10;describe, most of the features of MultiMarkdown.&#10;&#10;[MultiMarkdown User's Guide]: http://fletcherpenney.net/mmd/users_guide/&#10;  &quot;MultiMarkdown User's Guide&quot;&#10;"></outline>
<outline text="How to Use This Document" _note="I suggest comparing  the raw text source with the  various final outputs (e.g.&#10;PDF, XHTML, LaTeX, RTF)  in order to see what can  be accomplished. There will&#10;be  many similarities  between output  formats,  but also  a few  differences.&#10;Tables will  end up in  different places. Paragraphs  won't break in  the same&#10;way.  But these  differences are  superficial and  are a  result of  trying to&#10;optimize each format, without regard to identical output across formats (which&#10;would be virtually impossible).&#10;&#10;Remember, the main goal of Markdown\MultiMarkdown  is to allow you to create a&#10;document in  plain text,  with minimal  distraction from  markup, that  can be&#10;transformed into a variety of high quality outputs. Or, to quote John Gruber:&#10;&#10;&gt; The overriding design goal for Markdown's formatting syntax is to make it as&#10;readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be&#10;publishable as-is,  as plain text,  without looking  like it's been  marked up&#10;with  tags  or  formatting  instructions. While  Markdown's  syntax  has  been&#10;influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source&#10;of  inspiration   for  Markdown's   syntax  is  the   format  of   plain  text&#10;email.[#Gruber]&#10;&#10;[#Gruber]: John Gruber.  Daring Fireball: Markdown. [Cited January 2006]. &#10;  Available from &lt;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&gt;.&#10;"></outline>
<outline text="Where Can I Get a Copy?" _note="You can download a zipfile containing multiple formats of this document:&#10;&#10;* [MultiMarkdown-Gallery](http://fletcher.github.com/MultiMarkdown-Gallery)&#10;&#10;This file includes:&#10;&#10;*   The Scrivener source file&#10;*   A plain text file in MultiMarkdown format&#10;*   An XHTML file&#10;*   A PDF&#10;*   An RTF&#10;&#10;All files were generated automatically from the MultiMarkdown source document.&#10;"></outline>
<outline text="So, What Can This Document Demonstrate?" _note=""><outline text="Metadata" _note="First, take  a look  at the  overall structure  of the  document. At  the very&#10;beginning  is  metadata,  including   a  title,  author,  keywords,  copyright&#10;information, etc.  Where possible,  this metadata is  put to  appropriate use,&#10;otherwise it is  stored in a format  designed to be easily  read and minimally&#10;distracting:&#10;&#10;* In plain text and XHTML snippets[^snippets], it is located at the top of the&#10;  document.&#10;&#10;* In a full XHTML document, is located in the `&lt;head&gt;` section, and the title&#10;  and CSS metadata, if present, are used appropriately.&#10;&#10;* In a PDF generated from my XSLT files, metadata is used to generate the&#10;  appropriate fields (title, author, keywords) in the PDF itself. Some PDF&#10;  readers will let you examine this data. Additionally, the title, subtitle,&#10;  author, and copyright are placed at the beginning of the document.&#10;&#10;* In a Scrivener document, you can put the metadata in the first File in the&#10;  Binder, but the preferred location is in the &quot;MultiMarkdown Settings...&quot;&#10;  pane (in the File Menu.)&#10;&#10;There are a lot of standard metadata keys  that can be used, or you can create&#10;your own and use them as you see fit. Definitely a powerful feature.&#10;&#10;[^snippets]: An XHTML  snippet is my terminology for XHTML  code that does not&#10;include the `&lt;html&gt;`, `&lt;head&gt;`, and  `&lt;body&gt;` tags. Most browsers will display&#10;it  properly, but  it is  not a  complete XHTML  document. Without  a `&lt;head&gt;`&#10;section there is nowhere to put metadata(e.g. there is no `&lt;title&gt;`).&#10;"></outline>
<outline text="Structure" _note="The next thing  to look at is  the overall structure of the  document. You can&#10;visualize  a Markdown  document as  an  outline, with  different sections  and&#10;different levels within those sections. Based on your output format, these can&#10;be used to generate headers, or sections,  or even chapters. It's all based on&#10;what tools you use to process the XHTML output.&#10;&#10;Even within the XHTML document, however, you can make use of this structure to&#10;allow  easy navigation  within  the document.  You can  link  directly to  the&#10;[Introduction][] (and to [][Introduction] when using LaTeX), for instance. And&#10;if you are creating  a PDF, it will contain a hierarchy  of section names that&#10;you  can use  to  allow easy  navigation,  if your  PDF  reader supports  this&#10;function.&#10;"></outline>
<outline text="Footnotes" _note="Footnotes are  very easy to  implement in  MultiMarkdown, as described  in the&#10;MultiMarkdown Syntax Guide.[^somesamplefootnote]&#10;&#10;[^somesamplefootnote]: Here is the text of the footnote itself.&#10;"></outline>
<outline text="Tables" _note="Tables  can be  quite useful  for  showing data  in  a meaningful  way. As  an&#10;example, here is a table comparing [MultiMarkdown vs. Crayons][].&#10;&#10;[This is a caption with *italics*][MultiMarkdown vs. Crayons]  &#10;| Features                          | MultiMarkdown |  Crayons |  &#10;----------------------------------- | :-----------: | :------: |  &#10;Melts in warm places                |       No      |    Yes   |  &#10;Mistakes can be easily fixed        |      Yes      |    No    |  &#10;Easy to copy documents for friends  |      Yes      |    No    |  &#10;Fun at parties                      |  No[^parties] | Why not? |  &#10;&#10;Minimum markup for maximum quality? |      Yes      |    No    |  &#10;&#10;[^parties]: I guess it depends on what kind of parties you go to...&#10;"></outline>
<outline text="Typographical conventions" _note="By incorporating John Gruber's [SmartyPants][] program into your workflow, you&#10;can generate more  &quot;correct&quot; typographic punction in your XHTML  pages, and in&#10;your  LaTeX source  if  you are  generating PDF's---this  includes  en and  em&#10;dashes, and ellipses....&#10;&#10;Very nice when you want to focus on writing, not grammar.&#10;&#10;[SmartyPants]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/&#10;"></outline>
<outline text="Image Support" _note="If you choose to incorporate images in your documents, this can be easily done&#10;as well. MultiMarkdown  makes it easier to link to  images and include various&#10;attributes.&#10;&#10;As   an  example,   here  is   an  image   from  my   website  ---   [Nautilus&#10;Star](#nautilusstar). If you  have a local copy of the  image, you can include&#10;the image in a pdf.&#10;&#10;![This is a **bolded** caption][Nautilus Star]&#10;&#10;[Nautilus Star]: Nautilus_Star.png &quot;Nautilus Star&quot; width=&quot;3in&quot; height=&quot;2.4in&quot;&#10;"></outline>
<outline text="Bibliography Support" _note="MultiMarkdown offers  several mechanisms  for managing bibliographies.  It has&#10;built-in  support   for  basic   citation  and  bibliography   management  and&#10;formatting, or you  can rely on external  tools to handle this  for you. There&#10;aren't  many  citations in  this  document,  but I  think  it  gets the  point&#10;across.[p. 42][#fake]&#10;&#10;[#fake]: John Doe. *A Totally Fake Book*.  Vanity Press, 2006.&#10;"></outline>
<outline text="Glossary Support" _note="MultiMarkdown  has  a  special  format for  footnotes  that  should  represent&#10;glossary terms. This  doesn't make much difference in XHTML  (because there is&#10;no such thing as a glossary in XHTML),  but can be used to generate a glossary&#10;within LaTeX documents.&#10;&#10;For example,  let's have  an entry for  `glossary`.[^glossary] And  what about&#10;ampersands?[^amp]&#10;&#10;Since we  want the ampersand  entry to  be sorted with  the a's, and  not with&#10;symbols, we put in the optional sort key `ampersand` to control sorting.&#10;&#10;    [^glossary]: glossary: Glossary &#10;        A section at the end ...&#10;&#10;    [^amp]: glossary: &amp; (ampersand)&#10;        A punctuation mark ...&#10;&#10;[^glossary]: glossary: Glossary &#10;    A section at the end ...&#10;&#10;[^amp]: glossary: &amp; (ampersand)&#10;    A punctuation mark ...&#10;"></outline>
<outline text="Math Support" _note="It's pretty easy to include mathematical equations:&#10;&#10;\\[ {e}^{i\pi }+1=0 \\]&#10;&#10;\\[ {x}_{1,2}=\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{{b}^{2}-4ac}}{2a} \\]&#10;&#10;You can also include formulas within a sentence, such as&#10;\\({x}^{2}+{y}^{2}=1\\).&#10;"></outline>
